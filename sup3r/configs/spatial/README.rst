Spatial Super Resolving GAN configs
***********************************

This directory saves standard configs for spatial-only super resolving GAN
models. All generator model configs should start with "gen_*" and should have a
"4x" tag (for example) that represents the spatial enhancement that the
generator is designed for (e.g. "gen_4x.json" is a model that would enhance a
12km spatial field to 3km).
