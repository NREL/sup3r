The Super Resolution for Renewable Resource Data (sup3r) software uses
generative adversarial networks to create synthetic high-resolution wind and
solar spatiotemporal data from coarse low-resolution inputs. To get started,
check out the sup3r command line interface `(CLI)
<https://nrel.github.io/sup3r/_cli/sup3r.html#sup3r>`__.

Installing sup3r
================

NOTE: The installation instruction below assume that you have python installed
on your machine and are using `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html>`__
as your package/environment manager.

Option 1: Install from PIP (recommended for analysts):
------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new environment: ``conda create --name sup3r python=3.11``

2. Activate environment: ``conda activate sup3r``

3. Install sup3r: ``pip install NREL-sup3r``

4. Run this if you want to train models on GPUs: ``pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]``

   4.1 For OSX use instead: ``python -m pip install tensorflow-metal``

Option 2: Clone repo (recommended for developers)
-------------------------------------------------

1. from home dir, ``git clone git@github.com:NREL/sup3r.git``

2. Create ``sup3r`` environment and install package
    1) Create a conda env: ``conda create -n sup3r``
    2) Run the command: ``conda activate sup3r``
    3) ``cd`` into the repo cloned in 1.
    4) Prior to running ``pip`` below, make sure the branch is correct (install
       from main!)
    5) Install ``sup3r`` and its dependencies by running:
       ``pip install .`` (or ``pip install -e .`` if running a dev branch
       or working on the source code)
    6) Run this if you want to train models on GPUs: ``pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]``
    7) *Optional*: Set up the pre-commit hooks with ``pip install pre-commit`` and ``pre-commit install``
