Developed by NREL, Sup3r is open-source software that transforms coarse,
low-resolution data into actionable and accessible hyper-local data at
unprecedented speed and scale.

Sup3r (pronounced “super”) is open-source software paired with publicly
available datasets that leverages generative adversarial networks to
efficiently downscale global climate model data, improving resolution across
space and time while preserving physical accuracy.

By dramatically cutting computational time and cost, Sup3r delivers the data
needed for efficient, highly detailed energy system modeling and analysis.

How it Works
============
Sup3r uses a generative machine learning approach to produce synthetic
high-resolution spatiotemporal energy resource data from coarse, low-resolution
inputs. The process is described step-by-step below.

Step 1: Learns High-Resolution Physics From Historical Data (Training Phase)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

During what’s called the “training phase,” Sup3r learns how large-scale weather
patterns relate to local, detailed conditions using high-resolution historical
weather data. Its advanced model design allows it to learn from both simulated
data and real-world weather measurements. This helps build neural networks that
capture both scientific understanding and real data, making them useful for a
variety of applications.

At the heart of this process is a generative adversarial network (GAN), which
is like a game between two competing players:

- The Generator: Learns to create realistic high-resolution data from coarse
  climate inputs
- The Discriminator: Learns to tell the difference between real data (e.g.,
  observed high-resolution weather) and the Generator’s output.

Ultimately, the model’s success is determined by the Generator’s ability to
“fool” the Discriminator by producing data that is indistinguishable from
real-world data. By optimizing for both adherence to the climate inputs and
physical realism, Sup3r not only minimizes quantitative bias but also ensures
the physics of the high-resolution data are realistic. This is especially
important for downstream applications such as power system operational
modeling, where fine-scale spatial structure and high-frequency temporal
dynamics matter as much as statistical accuracy.

Step 2: Collects Coarse Climate Data and Scenarios
--------------------------------------------------

The Sup3r software can use input data from global climate models that have very
low resolutions (up to 100 kilometers wide per grid cell with 1 average data
point per day). This publicly available input data is useful for understanding
general trends but is too coarse to help with local decision making, like where
to place a wind farm or how a certain neighborhood might suffer from extreme
heat. One of Sup3r’s key strengths lies in its flexibility, allowing users to
choose from countless publicly available climate datasets. This feature
empowers users to easily explore various potential futures and make informed
decisions based on a range of possibilities.

Step 3: Generates Realistic, High-Resolution Climate Data (Inference Phase)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During what’s called the “inference phase,” Sup3r uses generative models that
were trained in Step 1 and the low-resolution climate data gathered in Step #2
to produce hyper-local data at a 0.5- to 4-kilometer resolution with a 5- to
60-minute frequency (depending on the application) for all requested
meteorological variables. Sup3r has been proven to generate output that
reproduces the large-scale dynamics in the data from Step 2 while capturing
realistic physics at the finest scales.

Applications of Sup3r
=====================

Sup3rCC
-------
Sup3rCC is an application of the Sup3r software that downscales global climate
model outputs to 4-km spatial and hourly temporal resolution. It provides
high-resolution data on temperature, humidity, wind, and solar irradiance,
supporting analysis of energy system resilience under future climate
conditions. Notably, Sup3rCC does not represent real historical weather events,
unlike Sup3rWind or Sup3rUHI (described below).

To learn more about Sup3rCC, check out the publication list below or the
`Sup3rCC example <https://github.com/NREL/sup3r/tree/main/examples/sup3rcc>`_.

Sup3rWind
---------
Sup3rWind uses the Sup3r software to produce high-resolution historical wind
resource data by downscaling global reanalysis datasets—which combine
historical weather observations with modern forecasting models—to 2-km spatial
and 5-minute temporal resolution. It improves the representation of extreme
wind events and preserves important spatiotemporal patterns for use in energy
system planning and operations. Sup3rWind data is used by wind energy
developers worldwide.

To learn more about Sup3rWind, check out the publication list below or the
`Sup3rWind example
<https://github.com/NREL/sup3r/tree/main/examples/sup3rwind>`_.

Sup3rUHI
--------
Sup3rUHI applies the Sup3r software to urban environments, combining satellite
observations and ground measurements to generate hyper-local temperature and
humidity time series. It supports both historical analysis and future scenario
modeling, enabling precise, data-driven planning for high-risk heat events.

To learn more about Sup3rUHI, check out the publication list below or the
`Sup3rUHI repo <https://github.com/NREL/sup3ruhi>`_.
