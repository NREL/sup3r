# Sphinx Documentation

The documentation is built with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html).
See their documentation for (a lot) more details.

## Installation

To generate the docs yourself, you'll need the appropriate package:

```
conda install sphinx
conda install sphinx_rtd_theme

pip install ghp-import
pip install sphinx-click
```

## Add any new CLI docs

- Create a new file .rest file in source/_cli
- Add the following to the top of the new CLI module's .rst file:
```
.. click:: module_path:main
   :prog: CLI-Alias # e.g. Sup3r
   :show-nested:
```
- `git push` changes to the documentation source code as needed.
- Make the documentation per below

git checkout gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
git checkout master # or whatever branch you were on
