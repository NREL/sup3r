Sup3rWind Examples
###################

Super-Resolution for Renewable Energy Resource Data with Wind from Reanalysis Data (Sup3rWind) is one application of the sup3r software. In this work, we train generative models to create high-resolution (2km 5-minute) wind data based on coarse (30km hourly) ERA5 data. The generative models and high-resolution output data is publicly available via the `Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI) <https://data.openei.org/s3_viewer?bucket=nrel-pds-wtk&prefix=sup3rwind%2F>`__ and via HSDS at the bucket ``nrel-pds-hsds`` and path ``/nrel/wtk/sup3rwind``. This data covers recent historical time periods for an expanding selection of countries.

Sup3rWind Data Access
----------------------

The Sup3rWind data and models are publicly available in a public AWS S3 bucket. The data files can be downloaded directly from there to your local machine or an EC2 instance using the `OEDI data explorer <https://data.openei.org/s3_viewer?bucket=nrel-pds-wtk&prefix=sup3rwind%2F>`__ or the `AWS CLI <https://aws.amazon.com/cli/>`__. A word of caution: there's a lot of data here. The smallest Sup3rWind file for just a single variable at 2-km 5-minute resolution is 130 GB.

The Sup3rWind data is also loaded into `HSDS <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/highly-scalable-data-service-hsds/>`__ so that you may stream the data via the `NREL developer API <https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/>`__ or your own HSDS server. This is the best option if you're not going to want a full annual dataset. See these `rex instructions <https://nrel.github.io/rex/misc/examples.hsds.html>`__ for more details on how to access this data with HSDS and rex.

Example Sup3rWind Data Usage
-----------------------------

Sup3rWind data can be used in generally the same way as `Sup3rCC <https://nrel.github.io/sup3r/examples/sup3rcc.html>`__ data, with the condition that Sup3rWind includes only wind data and ancillary variables for modeling wind energy generation. Refer to the Sup3rCC `example notebook <https://github.com/NREL/sup3r/tree/main/examples/sup3rcc/using_the_data.ipynb>`__ for usage patterns.

Running Sup3rWind Models
-------------------------

The process for running the Sup3rWind models is much the same as for `Sup3rCC <https://nrel.github.io/sup3r/examples/sup3rcc.html>`__.

#. Download the Sup3rWind models to your hardware using the AWS CLI: ``$ aws s3 cp s3://nrel-pds-wtk/sup3rwind/models/``
#. Download the ERA5 data that you want to downscale from `ERA5-single-levels <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview/>`__ and/or `ERA5-pressure-levels <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview/>`__.
#. Setup the Sup3rWind software. We recommend using `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ to manage your python environments. You can create a sup3r environment with the conda file in this example directory: ``$ conda env create -n sup3rwind --file env.yml``
#. Copy this examples directory to your hardware. You're going to be using the folder structure in ``/sup3r/examples/sup3rwind/run_configs`` as your project directories (``/sup3r/`` is a git clone of the sup3r software repo).
#. Navigate to ``/sup3r/examples/sup3rwind/run_configs/wind/`` and/or ``sup3r/examples/sup3rwind/run_configs/trhp`` and update all of the filepaths in the config files for the source ERA5 data, Sup3rWind models, and exogenous data sources (e.g. the ``topography`` source file).
#. Update the execution control parameters in the ``config_fwp_spatial.json`` file based on the hardware you're running on.
#. Run ``sup3r-pipeline`` to run just one job. There are also batch options for running multiple jobs, but we recommend starting with ``sup3r-pipeline`` (more on the sup3r `CLI <https://nrel.github.io/sup3r/_cli/sup3r.html>`__).
#. To run ``sup3r-pipeline``, make sure you are in the directory with the ``config_pipeline.json`` and ``config_fwp_spatial.json`` files, and then run this command: ``python -m sup3r.cli -c config_pipeline.json pipeline``
#. If you're running on a slurm cluster, this will kick off a number of jobs that you can see with the ``squeue`` command. If you're running locally, your terminal should now be running the Sup3rWind models. The software will create a ``./logs/`` directory in which you can monitor the progress of your jobs.
#. The ``sup3r-pipeline`` is designed to run several modules in serial, with each module running multiple chunks in parallel. Once the first module (forward-pass) finishes, you'll want to run ``python -m sup3r.cli -c config_pipeline.json pipeline`` again. This will clean up status files and kick off the next step in the pipeline (if the current step was successful).

Sup3rWind Versions
-------------------

The Sup3rWind data has versions that coincide with the sup3r software versions. Note that not every sup3r software version will have a corresponding Sup3rWind data release, but every Sup3rWind data release will have a corresponding sup3r software version.
